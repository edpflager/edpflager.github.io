![Locked](https://edpflager.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/https-294x300.png) Just an FYI - this site is now running with the HTTPS protocol rather than HTTP. If you have links to the old address, please update them. Thanks! Why some of you may ask? There are a variety of reasons, but they all revolve around security. If you use Chrome and visit an HTTP site, the browser marks it as not secure. HTTP sites are easier to hack which I found out last year.

And while traveling this year, I've been forced to become more security conscious. So why shouldn't my website be more security conscious too?
