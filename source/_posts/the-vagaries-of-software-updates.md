![crash](http://edpflager.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/crash-224x300.jpg)A short explanation for why the site has been quiet for a couple of weeks: In my last post I referenced updating to OS X Yosemite. While the operating system has been performing fairly well, one installed software package has not. For the most part, I use virtual machines to develop and test different things like Hadoop, SQL Server, Pentaho and various other items. This allows me to try out multiple packages and operating systems without the expense of a lot of physical boxes. For the host software, I have been using Fusion, the workstation software from VMWare that allows you to run multiple virtual systems on a Mac. The last time I upgraded my Mac's OS (less than a year ago to Mavericks), I had to fork over $45 to upgrade Fusion to overcome some issues with the new OS.

This time, the new Mac OS X made all of my VMs virtually unusable and once again, VMWare wants users to shell out some coin to upgrade rather than providing a patch to overcome the issue. Rather than continue on this roller coaster, I'm attempting to recreate my VMs in Virtual Box, the free open source platform for VMs. I moved one of my VMs over to it, however, and it crashed, so it looks like I am going to have to prune my VMs down and reinstall  them by hand, a timely process indeed. Thanks for coming to visit, and as soon as I can rectify this situation, I'll have some new posts up. Stuff that's in the works includes: Pentaho Lookups and Fuzzy Lookups, possibly an intro to the HBase shell, some R and R studio articles, and a look at Tableau (which I am learning for my new job).
