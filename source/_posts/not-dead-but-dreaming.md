Greetings! Its been almost a month since I posted anything. That's not because I've been inordinately busy at work or at home, just didn't have anything ready to post. Just as a teaser, I've been experimenting with Docker, using Pentaho and MongoDB together, and switched my Dell Inspiron from Ubuntu to Linux Mint. So hopefully, I'll have something useful to post soon.
