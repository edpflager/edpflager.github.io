Update: I never promised to be quick about restoring the contents, but here we are 3 months and change later, back up and running. :)  I have removed some of the older posts, mostly older photographs, and reviews of things I'm no longer interested in. The focus here now will probably be a bit narrower than its been in the past, and shifting a bit. Hopefully it remains interesting for some. I'm experiencing some technical difficulties with this website. If there is older content you are interested in seeing, please check the Internet Wayback Machine at [https://web.archive.org/web/\*/edpflager.com.](https://web.archive.org/web/*/edpflager.com) Since this is a non-commercial site, I'll attempt to get my older content restored as soon as possible.
