[![epic-fail](http://edpflager.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/epic-fail-300x240.jpg)](http://edpflager.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/epic-fail.jpg)I killed off my Yahoo email account this week. I had used that address for close to ten years, and I was very reluctant to get rid of it. It was the address I had given out to a whole bunch of friends and acquaintances. I had used it to buy way more products that I really care to think about. And it was an account I checked too frequently throughout the day. So what changed? Yahoo did. Over the course of the last six months, I've had too many problems with that account. More than what should be expected. Granted it was a FREE account, so the old axiom that you get what you pay for definitely holds true. But for years it had been a rock solid platform. So what happened?

*   First I went through a period of about a week where I didn't get any new email. Yahoo reported no outages on any social media or their home page, and I could still log into the account. I just wasn't getting anything. Finally, I started digging into it, and discovered that a setting from more than five years ago had been reactivated. Email was being forwarded to another account that I no longer have access to. WTF?!!!
*   Then Yahoo redesigned the interface. I wasn't crazy about it, but meh - I could live with it.
*   Then they redesigned the interface AGAIN. And it was worse!
*   This was followed by SPAM filter malfunctions, and my inbox was flooded with crap that any rudimentary filter should have caught.
*   Finally, the web interface became unusable on my Macbook. It appeared to lock up for several minutes at a time, until a little link would should up in the bottom of the window, asking Too slow? Switch to classic view. But I couldn't find anyplace to make classic view the default!

So I finally decided, me and Yahoo were going to go our separate ways. Sniff. Too bad, but nothing stays the same for ever. If you've emailed me at my Yahoo address and gotten a bounced email, sorry. Shoot me an email through the contact page on this website, and I will get back to you with my new address.
