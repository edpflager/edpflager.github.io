[![bigdataglossary](http://edpflager.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/bigdataglossary.gif)](http://edpflager.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/bigdataglossary.gif)A few weeks back I posted about a new trend in IT called Big Data, and because I like to stay marketable in my chosen field, I’ve started playing around with some Big Data tools. For those looking for a primer on Big Data, the various applications and technologies , and a way to make sense of it all, I can’t recommend enough the [Big Data Glossary](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022466.do) by Pete Warden from O’Reilly Media.

It’s a small 62 page book, that starts with a terms chapter providing some plain English (or as close as possible) explanations of the lingo that is used throughout the rest of the book.

From there it parses the Big Data world into logical groupings, such as NoSQL databases, Storage Systems, Processing, and Visualization with a couple of paragraphs devoted to each of the many applications/technologies in that category.

As a relative newcomer to the Big Data arena, this book provided just enough detail to let me examine the Big Data landscape from a 10,000 foot view and learn what technology complemented others, which were trying to achieve the same end results, and the best usage for each. From there I was able to decide where I wanted to dive in. More about that coming soon!
