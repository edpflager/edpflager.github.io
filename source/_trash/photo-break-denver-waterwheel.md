![](https://edpflagercom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/b3312-sevenfalls30x24.jpg?w=300&h=125)[![](http://edpflager.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Waterwheel-small.tiff)](http://edpflager.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Waterwheel-small.tiff) It's been awhile since I've posted a photo (or anything else - work and personal life extremely busy as of late) so here is an image from Denver last week. It was a short three day trip, but got to a lot of different areas. A beautiful part of the United States to visit and hike.

This image is from an area called [Seven Falls](https://www.broadmoor.com/broadmoor-adventures/seven-falls/) which is actually down near Colorado Springs. Its a privately owned tourist attraction, but don't let that stop you from visiting it if you are in the area. A leisurely mile walk through some gorgeous scenery before you get to the base of an almost three hundred foot stair (seen in the left of this image) that takes you up to a plateau for an additional mile of hiking.
